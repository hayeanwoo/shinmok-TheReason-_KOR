💡 Why This Story Matters Now

The Dangsan Tree, which plays an important role in this work, is a traditional Korean object of worship. In recent years, it has gained global attention, even appearing in the Netflix anime “K-POP Demon Hunters”.

Additionally, in Japan, there is a recurring surge of interest in occult, horror, and nostalgic story-driven games during the summer season. We believe this work aligns perfectly with that seasonal mood.

→ In other words, this is a story that should be told “right now.”
